I have an UI which shows financials for the selected client. Wanted to Automate scenario where user search for a Client from the predefined list of clients in excel/csv format and validate its financials for each client. 

What I have :
1)	Three Types of mapping
a.	List of companies.xlsx in excel Tab :”company_ID”
b.	List of SDSID and ClientID mapping in excel Mapping1.xlsx, Following is the mapping :
i.	Partyid column of this excel sheet Mapping1.xlsx = company_ID column of companies.xls(tabname=Mapping_sept)
ii.	capitalID = sdsid
c.	Data Dictionary for all the financial attribute mapping with following details :
i.	Display Sequency : based on this sequence attribute should appear in UI
ii.	Proj ID
iii.	Proj Attribute name
iv.	Section
v.	Subsection
vi.	Maping Type
vii.	Calculated (Y/N)
viii.	Editable in Historicals(y/n) 
ix.	Calculations
